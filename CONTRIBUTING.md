## How to contribute to SlingshotDB
#### **Did you find a bug?**
* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead email the team at 
slingshotdb[]scriptjungle[]de. * **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under 
[Issues](https://github.com/voodooEntity/slingshotdb/issues). * If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the 
problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/voodooEntity/slingshotdb/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and 
clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test 
case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. * If possible, use the relevant bug report 
templates to create the issue.
#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or implements a feature?**
* We apply [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), please have a look at it before 
submitting a PR. * Open a new branch with the name `issue-###` with the issue-ID of your bug/feature, create 
an issue if there isn't one already. * Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
* Ask! There is no such thing as stupid questions :smile:
#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**
* Please do! Suggestions on where we could host it? Let us know! Thanks!  

sincerely yours, voodooEntity
